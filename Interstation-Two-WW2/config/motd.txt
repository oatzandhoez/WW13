<h2>Welcome to <b><span style = "font-size: 1.2em;">Lebensraum</span></b></h2>
<h3>This is an <b>ALPHA</b> build of a new World War 2 server. Expect bugs. We are not up 24/7. You can find various useful links, such as our Github and Discord, at <a href = "https://mechahitler.co.nf/index.php">our custom hub</a>.<br>
<h3>Having issues accessing racks and radio UIs? First use the Clear Cache verb in the OOC tab, then try reinstalling, downgrading, or upgrading your BYOND version, or deleting your entire cache folder and rejoining. BYOND renders HTML through Internet Explorer/Edge, so try clearing your cache there or reinstalling the browser, as a last resort.<br></h3>
<h2>Want to donate? <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/worldwar2inspace">Here's our Patreon</a>.</h2>We need a minimum of $49 a month to run our dedicated server!<br></h3>
